# portfolio
My first approach to make a portofilo site.

As the first official project, that I worked on during my time in DCI, I am aware that it is not fully perfect and even with that process I still can see things that I can work on and improve.

Also I would like to note the fact, that for me personally the topic, at this stage of learning after all, was not the easiest - in a way of creating the professional content, but showing my skills as well.

Nevertheless the idea behind the project was to try make clear and "easy looking" website that would introduce me a little bit more to my class mates and teachers.

The site contains:
1. Main Page - where I introduce myself, and give a little preview of what to expect on the subpages;
2. About Me Page - where I wrote about myself more and my life and work experiences;
3. Projects Page - where I put the cards with, so far imaginary projects, and little description of them;
4. Contact Page - where I wrote down links to my socials and put form thAt later can be used to contact me.

The site also contains:
1. 4 files of HTML code;
2. 1 CSS file (I was advised to put everything in one, and booooy, it was a challenge);
3. In total 1897 lines of code in all the files (of which 1135 is CSS);
4. 12 pictures in total, where 6 of them are pics used for "imaginery projects".

A fun thing to add to my site was also a a sign from W3C CSS Validator:
"This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG !"
You can see it in footer of every subpage of my project.

With that thoughts, ENJOY MY PROJECT! ;)
